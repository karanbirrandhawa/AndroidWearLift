# Android Wear Lift 

An Android library built for recording fitness/exercise data on Android Wear devices, for the moment mainly reps. Made extremely easy to drop and use on any Android project, our goal is to provide a module that can help Wear fitness app developers to easily and reliably handle about simple recording (and maybe one day, complex recording).

## History

We started development for this application some time ago at a hackathon. At first it started off as a fitness tracker application that would accurately log your exercise statistics and allow you to analyze them. However this idea fell out some time after the hackathon. Still, impressed with the effort that we've made we decided to try to release our completed products one by one as libraries and build on them, hopefully to give other developers an easier chance to pick up where we left off. 

## Concept and Implementation


## Exercises

We have a number of exercises we plan to implement. Currently we are taking the safest and most accurate ones and putting them on there.
