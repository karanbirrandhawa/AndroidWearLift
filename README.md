** Note that this library is in early stages of development and not ready for production** 

# Android Wear Lift 

An Android library built for recording fitness/exercise data on Android Wear devices, for the moment mainly reps. Made extremely easy to drop and use on any Android project, our goal is to provide a module that can help Wear fitness app developers to easily and reliably handle about simple recording (and maybe one day, complex recording).

## History

We started development for this application some time ago at a hackathon. At first it started off as a fitness tracker application that would accurately log your exercise statistics and allow you to analyze them. However this idea fell out some time after the hackathon. Still, impressed with the effort that we've made we decided to try to release our completed products one by one as libraries and build on them, hopefully to give other developers an easier chance to pick up where we left off. 

## Library

The repository itself can be imported immediately into Android Studio while taking into account that it consists of three different modules:

* `androidwearlift`
* `mobile`
* `wear`

Only the `androidwearlift` module is relevant to the library while the `mobile` and `wear` modules are to create a demo application to use. While importing you can choose to only import the `androidwearlift` library and with Gradle you can feel free to set it as one of your dependencies. 

## Data

Currently with our library you can record the following fitness data about the user:

* Reps
* Coming Soon

Our rep count is implemented via an internal state machine that will use a (somewhat) customized algorithm for each respective exercise within our supported exercises. 

## Implementation

Our goal is to make it extremely easy for you to get started on using the library. After adding the module `androidwearlift` you can start to use library functions. 

### Rep Counting

The rep-counter is controlled by an internal state machine that is specified by the respective "Manager" class that you use. An example is shown below for `BicepCurlManager`.

Take the class `ExampleSensorEventListener` that extends `SensorEventListener`

  public class ExampleSensorEventListener implements SensorEventListener {
    ..
    BicepCurlManager manager;
    ..
  }
  
This class within its constructor must initialize `manager` in order to prepare ourselves for recording the next set of exercise data. So within `ExampleSensorEventListener`:

  public ExampleSensorEventListener(... args ...) {
    ..
    ..
     manager = new BicepCurlManager() {
      @Override
      protected void onRepIncrease() {
        reps++;
        textView.setText(Integer.toString(reps));
        }
      };
  }
  
As you may have noticed `onRepIncrease()` is a function that we force you to implement. What it is responsible for is ensuring that at the completion of every rep cycle you will be able to execute your own custom code. In the case of th example above, this is to update the value of a `reps` variable and set its text to a TextView to display to the user.

In order to power our internal state machine we need to provide `BicepCurlManager` with the appropriate data. We do this by the `updateEvent` method which allows us to pass a `SensorEvent` to it and interpret it to see things such as the current position, acceleration, etc. In the case of our current example, we would implement the following code:

  @Override
  public void onSensorChanged(SensorEvent event) {
    if (event.sensor.getType() == Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER) {
      manager.updateEvent(event);
    }
  }

Currently you are responsible for ensuring the appropriate values, i.e. if it requires accelerometer sensor values then you should updateEvent which `getType()` is an accelerometer. This will likely change soon as we update the library to do this sort of thing for you. The documentation will be updated soon to specify which event values are required for each Manager.

## Exercises

We have a number of exercises we plan to implement. Currently we are taking the safest and most accurate ones and putting them on there. These are the ones that we mainly tested at the hackathon: the bicep curl and the shoulder fly. The algorithm behind these two will be explored and explained within this readme at a future date.

## Demo

We've included a demo application that can be installed onto an Android Wear smartwatch (5.0-compliant) and test our algorithms our out for yourselves.
